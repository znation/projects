By counting carefully it can be seen that a rectangular grid measuring 3 by 2 contains eighteen rectangles:

6 (one square)
4 (two squares horizontal)
2 (three squares horizontal)
3 (two squares vertical)
2 (four squares square)
1 (the whole thing)

Although there exists no rectangular grid that contains exactly two million rectangles, find the area of the grid with the nearest solution.
